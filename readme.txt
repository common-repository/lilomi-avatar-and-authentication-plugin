Lil'Omi adds cross-site Facebook Connect support to your WordPress or BuddyPress site.

== Description ==

Extremely easy to use. Just install and enter your email address. Users will immediately be able to log in with just a few clicks using Facebook Connect through Lil'Omi.

Users who login with Lil'Omi can customize a cool 2D avatar for themselves and select a username which becomes their default WordPress username and avatar on your site with a simple authentication step using Facebook Connect.

Lil'Omi makes user sign up simple. If a user has already signed in with Lil'Omi on one WordPress site, they are automatically signed into any other WordPress or Buddypress site that also uses the plugin.

Changes that this plugin makes to your site:

* Lets your users have a unique, customizable avatar with millions of possible combinations.
* Adds a "Login with Lil'Omi" button to your log in, registration, and comment forms visible to logged-out users.
* Allows users to sign in via Facebook without sharing their personal name or photo with your site.
* Makes new user registration much easier for users.
* Increases the amount of users that sign up for your site by automatically signing in users that have already used Lil'Omi on other sites.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the `lilomi-avatar-and-authentication-plugin` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Enter your email in the plugin settings.

== Screenshots ==

1. **Instant Authentication** - Users can quickly sign in with one click using a Lil'Omi identity through Facebook. Or they are automatically signed in if they already have an account.
2. **Quick Avatar Selection** - Users can pick a username and avatar when they first make their account without leaving your site.
3. **High Level of Customizability** - Features powerful avatar customization.
4. **Friend Connections** - Users can use their Lil'Omi to represent themselves on your site, or they can upload another profile picture.
